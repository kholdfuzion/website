So it seems there isn't an existing way to add internal ipfs daemon to java app. Closest I've found so far is [https://ianopolous.github.io/java/IPFS](https://ianopolous.github.io/java/IPFS), which still requires a local node. If anyone has information on selfhosting a node in java, email me please.

There are official nodes in go and js, not sure which may be the better path. Also is there a way to use ipfs to host a public api node?
