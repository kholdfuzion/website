Recently got a [64drive HW3](http://64drive.retroactive.be/). Quite a nice piece of hardware.

As I have not found any documentation or examples covering wifi card usage, expect posts on that as I make/find some.

Also I discovered there is no way to do breakpoints over usb for debugging existing code...something like the partner n64 setup would be nice :)

If you're getting started in n64 dev you'll find QmeKxyAorKEhq2aDARutPbnZ9HDrFa7qjYdwwFkud9X623 useful.
