Finally got around to putting up a site here. For those interested I use Pelican with a makefile modded to publish to ipfs and my dns is set to redirect to my ipns entry on an ipfs gateway. 

As a backup this site can be reached via [ipfs.io gateway](http://gateway.ipfs.io/ipns/kholdfuzion.net/)

Bonus use [this for firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ipfs-gateway-redirect/) or [this for chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-station/kckhgoigikkadogfdiojcblegfhdnjei) with a local ipfs daemon for increased browsing speed to ipfs hosted sites.
